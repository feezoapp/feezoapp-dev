    //    sport must stop appearing there for that sport — otherwise staff
    //    can keep marking attendance and collecting fees against a batch
    //    the student left months ago.
    //  - historyByStudent: EVERY row, active or not, with the full
    //    active/left_date/end_reason/end_notes metadata attached. This is

    //    row per sport/batch segment that overlapped the period being
    //    viewed. That's what lets a student who switched batches mid-month
    //    still show correct attendance/fee rows for their OLD sport/batch,
    //    scoped to the months they were actually in it, instead of that
    //    history disappearing the moment a newer enrollment supersedes it.
    //    Do not trim this down to active-only or drop join_date/left_date

    //    month/year views with no error, just missing old rows.
